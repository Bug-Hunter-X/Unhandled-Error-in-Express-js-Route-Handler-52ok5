This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  failure to handle invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, which attempts to parse a user ID from a request parameter without error checking.  This can lead to unexpected crashes or exceptions. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by adding robust error handling to gracefully handle non-numeric user IDs.
